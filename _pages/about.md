## Me

I am a PhD candidate currently studying evolutionary genomics in [Ben Evans’ lab](http://benevanslab.wordpress.com/) at McMaster University. I completed my undergrad at the University of Alberta in April 2012, with a specialization degree in Animal Biology. Broadly speaking, I am interested in Evolution and all its peculiarities. At the moment I am working with high throughput genomic data to understand general evolutionary forces that shape aspects of an organism’s genome (particularly sex chromosomes and duplicate genes).

## The Thesis
My Ph.D. thesis is focussed on 2 broad areas of research:

1. [Sex Chromosome Evolution](/_pages/sex_chr_project/)
2. Polyploid Genome Evolution

I work with African clawed frogs (*Xenopus*) as the entire genus is tetraploid (at minimum, to dodecaploid i.e. 12 copies!), has multiple sex determining systems with homomorphic sex chromosomes, and some species contain the only know master regulator of sex in amphibians (*DM-W*). These frogs have been used as medical and scientific models for many years and are an invasive species in some areas, potentially causing great ecological impact.


## Genetics and Species

Another interest of mine is to use genetic tools to assess species dynamics. Recently, my colleagues and I have studied the phylogeography of the most widespread African clawed frog (*Xenopus laevis*), providing insight in to the overall genetic structuring of this species and gene flow between it and its close relatives. We've also investigated genetic introgression of the extremely vulnerable *X. gilli* and sympatric *X. laevis* populations. For my undergrad thesis, I assessed the impact of urban development on the genetic connectivity of a wood frog (*Rana sylvatica*) population.
