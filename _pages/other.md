## McMaster Thesis Template

I maintain a LaTeX version of the McMaster Thesis template. This template should cover the general specifications for both Masters and Ph.D. thesis formats. Some tweaking may be necessary, but this provides the general layout and has been used by many M.Sc. and Ph.D. students already.

The most recent version available from my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/benjaminfurman/McMaster_Thesis_Template).

An occasionally updated version is available in the [Overleaf templates gallery](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/mcmaster-thesis-example/bjccppctqwgt#.V_wpQNxD9E4).
