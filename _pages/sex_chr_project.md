## Sex chromosomes...

#### sounds...sexy

You bet it is! Sex chromosomes are the portions of the genome that hold the keys to the differentiation of females and males. Sex chromosomes are common in animals, and appear elsewhere in the tree of life too. Some animals use temperature to distinguish sex and others have just a single sex. I find sex chromosomes particularly fascinating. For diploid and diploid like species (i.e. species with more than two copies of their genomes but genetically behave like diploids), there are pairs of chromosomes. One of these pairs are the sex chromosomes and unlike all the other chromosomes they are not equally shared between the sexes.

In mammals this pair of chromosomes are called the X and the Y. The X chromosome occurs in two copies in females, and only one copy in males. The Y chromosome holds the gene that leads to male development and thus only occurs in males (Fig. 1). Another system also exists, where the sex chromosomes are called the Z and the W. This system is the exact opposite of the XY system. In ZW systems, the Z chromosome is in two copies in males, and one copy in females. The W is present only in females and, in some taxa, it will contain a gene that leads to female development. Alternatively, sex may be determined by a gene on the Z chromosome, and males develop because they have two copies and females develop because they have one copy of the gene; this is the case in birds (well...mostly).

This unequal sharing of chromosomes and sex specificity of chromosomes is what gives the sex chromosomes their unique properties. They experience different levels of selection, compared to the rest of the genome (owing to their suppressed effective population size), and they disproportionately contribute to speciation, infertility and other similar phenomena.

## More curiosities
Proper development of female and male is critical to being able to breed, promoting the continuation of genetic lineages. The cascade that determines sex is quite tightly regulated and largely similar across the a wide variety of taxa. For vertebrates most of the cascade is the same (or quite similar), and the same genes can even been found in the genetic cascade controlling sexual development in vertebrates and invertebrates.

Surprising it is then to learn that the master regulators of sex (i.e. the genes that set off this cascade of genetic interactions) are highly variable. Even very closely related species may have very different master regulators. For placental mammals, *SRY* controls sex, but this gene has been lost in numerous taxa (leaving the job up to yet to be discovered genes). In birds, the gene is (mostly) *dmrt1*, which is a very curious gene. For most other taxa, the genes in charge are an absolute mystery. For taxa fish, lizards, and frogs, there is immense variability in sex chromosome systems (ZW or XY) and perhaps equal variability in the master regulators...or perhaps not...

## My Project

I study *Xenopus*, the African clawed frogs. I'll do up an introduction to them one day, but they are very curious aquatic frogs. For some species we know that they have ZW sex chromosomes and in some taxa there exists a gene called *DM-W*, which sites on the W chromosomes are its expression leads to female development.

My research focuses on *X. borealis*, a species that appears to lack *DM-W*. My aim is to explore homology (or, lack there of) between this species, the *DM-W* containing species, and the other clade of clawed frogs *Silurana tropicalis*. I am also exploring the sex determining system of *X. borealis*, attempting to find out what is controlling sex determination in this species.

With this project, we have found support for a model where certain genetic elements are use repeatedly for control of the sex determining in very different species. Basically, when there is a change in the sex determining system, it might not be a completely novel genetic element. Support for this has been found for other species (like birds and a gecko having the same sex chromosomes; fish and mammals and a lizard), and we are adding another case to these studies (results in a forthcoming paper -- in Review).
