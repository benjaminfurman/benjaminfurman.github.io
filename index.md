## Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate currently studying evolutionary genomics of amphibians in [Ben Evansâ€™ lab](http://benevanslab.wordpress.com/) at McMaster University. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Alberta in April 2012, with a specialization in Animal Biology.

## Ph.D. Dissertation
My research has focussed on two areas of evolutionary genomics:

1. [Sex Chromosome Evolution](/_pages/sex_chr_project/)
2. Polyploid Genome Evolution

I work with African clawed frogs (*Xenopus*) as the genus contains mostly tetraploid and up to dodecaploid (i.e., 12 copies of each chromosome!) species, has multiple sex determining systems with homomorphic sex chromosomes, and some species contain the only known master regulator of sex in amphibians (*DM-W*). These frogs have been used as medical and scientific models for many years and are an invasive species in some areas, potentially causing great ecological impact.


## Genetics and Species

Another interest of mine is to use genetic tools to assess species dynamics. Recently, my colleagues and I have studied the phylogeography of the most widespread African clawed frog (*Xenopus laevis*), providing insight in to the overall genetic structure of this species and gene flow between it and its close relatives. We've also investigated genetic introgression of the extremely vulnerable *X. gilli* and sympatric *X. laevis* populations. For my undergrad thesis, I assessed the impact of urban development on the genetic connectivity of a wood frog (*Rana sylvatica*) population. See the [publications page](/_pages/publications/) for papers relating to these projects.
